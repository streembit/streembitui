        <h4>Streembit security implementation and design summary</h4>
        </br>
        <div>
            <p>The cornerstone of Streembit security is elliptic curve public/private key cryptography infrastructure (PPKI). PPKI allows the implementation of robust security. We use PPKI to identify the entities of the system (based on their public key and PPKI signature), perform authentication, and ensure data integrity (using cryptography signatures). Using the public/private key cryptography infrastructure paves the way for the deployment of a robust, secure authentication and access control scheme. The parties are identified by their public key. The authenticity of messages and the identities of the actors are then verified using PPKI cryptography routines. Using a PPKI infrastructure based security scheme greatly simplifies the authentication, access control, and identity management aspects of Internet-of-Things security.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:30px;">The basic premises of the Streembit security are…</p>            
            <ul>
                <li>Human users and Internet of Things devices use public/private key (PPK) infrastructure and PPK cryptography functions to secure messages</li>
                <li>Each actor of the system must generate a public/private key pair. (Typically keys are generated prior to configuring the device and will be burned into the devices’ firmware).</li>
                <li>The device or user publishes the public key to other users of the system.</li>
                <li>The data integrity and authenticity of the messages is guaranteed with PPK signatures.</li>
                <li>Each session between users is secured with strong symmetric cryptography keys.</li>
                <li>All messages between users are secured with 128-bit and 256-bit AES symmetric encryption/decryption.</li>
                <li>The system uses elliptic curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchange algorithms to facilitate the exchange of session keys.</li>
            </ul>
