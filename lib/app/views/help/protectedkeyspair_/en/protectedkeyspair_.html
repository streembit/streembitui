        <h4>Protecting the ECC public/private key pair</h4>
        </br>
        <div>
            <p>The ultimate issue of all applications, systems, and devices that protect data with cryptography is the security of the symmetric key of the encryption or the private key of the public/private key pair. Similarly to the iPhone and PGP, which both use passcode to protect their keys, Streembit requires users have a passcode to protect their PPKI private key. The Streembit passcode that protects the userâ€™s PPK key pair is relatively complex.</p>
            <p>To protect real time communication, Streembit uses a randomly generated 256-bit AES session key and exchanged between peers with a randomly generated ECDH key pair. This means that real time communication, which is the main functionality of Streembit, is secure even from the brute force attacks of NSA super computers and large zombie computer clusters of cyber criminals.</p>
