        <h4>Share your public key with your Streembit hub contacts</h4>
        <div>
            <p>The seed nodes and client nodes of a private Streembit hub identify users by a) validating their PPK signature, b) looking up the account name from a configuration list. That means seeds and clients must know about the public keys and account names of the participants on a the private Streembit hub. Therefore, prior to connecting a private Streembit hub you must share your account details with at least the seed node of private Streembit hub. Typically, you would do this by configuring the seed node configuration file with the list of contacts. (Please refer to the private network readme document at the Streembit Github repository how to create the configuration file for a private Streembit hub.)</p>
            <p>To get your public key either create a new account or initialize an existing account. Click on the Streembit/New account menu item to create a new account or click on the Streembit/Initialize existing account to use an existing account. Once your account is initialized click on the Tools/Account security info menu item. Your account name and public key will be displayed on the screen. Add this  account name and public key data to the configuration file of private Streembit hub seed.</p>
