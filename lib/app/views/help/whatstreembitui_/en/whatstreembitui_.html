        <h4>What is Streembit?</h4>
        </br>
        <div>
            <p>Streembit(TM) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) real time communication system for humans and machines. The application enables a system that securely manages humans-to-machine and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication without using a central server or client-server infrastructure. The actors of the system are ‘nodes’ on a peer-to-peer network.</p>
            <p>Hardware services are manifested in Smart Contracts that are accessible via messages and transactions. The system uses a Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT) to discover human and machine nodes on the network.</p>
            <p>The Streembit™ system ensures data integrity using public-private key (PPK) cryptography. Messages are signed with the contact’s private key on the client side using ECDSA cryptography. The data is encrypted using ECDH key exchange to exchange the cryptography keys between the contacts and AES symmetric encryption. The video and audio chat feature utilizes ‘WebRTC’, the protocol that allows a fully encrypted video and audio communication in a true P2P manner, without routing the conversation through of any central servers.</p>
            <p>Streembit™ aims to comply with open security and communication standards. The compliance is verifiable via peer review of the Streembit™ open source system. Streembit™ is built on FIPS, IETF and W3C security; data and communication standards such as JWT, JWS, WebRTC, as well as the latest planned and actual standards from W3C ‘Web of Things’ initiative. The system uses recommended curves for the ECDSA and ECDH elliptic curve cryptography functions.
            Decentralisation addresses several major system and business requirements. Decentralised systems are scalable; in fact they become more stable if there are more active users. This means that no expensive cluster servers are needed to run a decentralised system. The peers make up the system with their home and office computers, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>
            <p>Decentralised systems are the composite of their peers, and are always available as long as at least two peers are connected. On the other hand, centralised systems require expensive load balancers, and even more costly data centres across geographical regions to provide high availability. A decentralised P2P system makes centralised high-cost server infrastructures obsolete.</p>
            <p>Human right activists, dissidents, and citizens who stand up against totalitarian states and undemocratic policies also need a secure communication tool. Oppressive regimes are even cracking down on critics beyond their own borders. Business users and members of the public also have a right to expect their communications are private as are their IOT networks at work and at home. A decentralised P2P system, in which the communication is fully encrypted between the users, preserves privacy without using a central server, and keeps the data safe from oppressive regimes and ensures a conversation you intend to be private remains just so.</p>
