            <p>You can perform an account backup to save a local copy of your Streembit account data. The Streembit account can be restored from a backup using the “Restore account” function.</p>
            <p>In order to backup the account the account must be initialized. Click on the Actions/Backup account on the menu bar to start backup your account.</p>
            <p>Your account backup data is never saved on a central server by the Streembit application and the account backup file is saved to your Download directory.</p>

            <div class="settings-helpitem-title">What is saved in the Backup file?</div>
            <p>The backup file contains your encrypted Streembit ECC public/private key pair. The backup data is base64 encoded. It starts with “---BEGIN Streembit KEY---“, and the file ends with “---END Streembit KEY---“</p>
