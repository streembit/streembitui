        <h4>Internet of Things devices</h4>

            <p>Streembit is a unified communication platform for both human users and Internet of Things devices.</p>

            <p>Streembit manages device discovery as well as authentication, access control and provisioning of devices without using a centralized authority server. The system facilitates device discovery and device control in a peer to peer manner. For many IoT use cases a decentralized, P2P network topology is the most secure, robust, scalable and reliable method of operation. Instead of using expensive corporate owned third party cloud systems, Streembit manages Internet of Things devices without the need of proprietary centralized cloud platforms. Centralized, corporate owned cloud is certainly an easier way to build out IoT platforms. However, the owners and authorities in these topologies all have an influence upon the network and can be exploited. They can ban devices, spy on devices and compromise data integrity of devices. In fact, government can order them to do any or all of these. In the near future, the doors of your garage and home, air conditioning units and your home security system will be fully internet connected. You will be able to control your home automation system from your mobile phone. It is essential that only you can control your IoT devices. Streembit excludes third party service and cloud providers from the ecosystem to give full control to the end users over the devices.</p>

            <p>The primary premise of this system is that all aspects of the IoT device operation must consist of decentralized P2P communication between the device and human user. For example, in the case of a building’s door device: a secure and decentralized P2P system can manage the door (including device configuration, upgrades and provisioning). There is no need to involve a centralized server nor a cloud based solution in order to implement a secure and fully operation Internet of Things system.</p>

            <div style="margin-top:30px;font-weight:bold">Internet of Things device discovery on Streembit</div>
            <p>Streembit allows IoT application providers and context producers to register their IoT Objects on the decentralised Streembit network, and in turn allow context consumers to discover them in a secure and peer to peer manner. </p>

            <div style="margin-top:30px;font-weight:bold">Control Internet of Things devices via Streembit</div>
            <ul>
                <li>The Internet of Things devices and human users communicate with each other directly in a peer to peer manner</li>
                <li>The data is end to end encrypted between the human user and IoT device. The encryption key is shared only between the user and device – never with any third parties.</li>
                <li>The device exposes functionalities via the Streembit network and user interface using W3C WoT standards</li>
                <li>The user interacts with the device via the Streembit P2P layer and UI. For example, opening a door, turning ON a light, controlling motor speed, getting temperature data, viewing CCTV pictures etc. all peer to peer, without a centralised solution and via the Streembit user interface.</li>

            <div style="margin-top:30px;font-weight:bold">Upgrade and manage Internet of Things devices via Streembit</div>
            <ul>
                <li>Hardware and software providers upgrade Internet of Things devices on the always up and running Streembit network.</li>
                <li>Internet of Things device manufacturers and software designers publishes firmware and software updates via the Streembit network.</li>
                <li>Internet of Things devices run the Streembit system and ensure the origin and data integrity of the updates by verifying the public key of the publisher.</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="margin-top:30px;font-weight:bold">Standards</div>
            <p>The Streembit Internet of Things system is based on the latest W3C Web of Things standards. The system incorporates the latest modules from the W3C web-of-things-framework. The devices are defined with JSON-LD and the security uses FIPS standards for cryptography and JWT, JWS and JWE standards to secure data.</p>

            <p>To integrate devices with Streembit please refer to the IoT section of the Streembit Github repository.</p>
