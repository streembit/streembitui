                <span>Your contacts identify your account and validate your identity using your PPK public key. The public/private key pair is created using a random entropy - once it is created then it cannot be changed. The public/private key pair isnâ€™t deterministic and in order to communicate with your contacts, you must use the same public key which was published to the Streembit network and known to your contacts. The published public key can be restored from an account backup file.</span>
            </p>
            <p>You can restore your Streembit account data on any computer from a backup file.</p>
            <p>Click on the Actions/Restore account on the menu bar or the Restore account to start restoring the account from a backup file.</p>
