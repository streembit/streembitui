                      	<p>The Streembit system forms a decentralized peer to peer network to manage connections between machines and machines or humans and machines.  The participants in the network are the peer nodes. The peer to peer network is scalable and an unlimited number of nodes can participate in the network.</p>
			            <p>The system performs public private key infrastructure based authentication and access control functions to securely connect peer nodes. The application generates at least one private/public key pair on each peer node including on the Internet-of-Things devices. The actors of the system publish their public keys to the peer to peer network via a Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT). Each peer node knows the public key of the other connected peer nodes.  The system identifies peer nodes in the peer to peer network by their public key. To ensure data integrity the nodes sign the messages with their private key. The nodes sign all messages -  there are no unsigned messages circulated in the system. (The requirement for signing the messages also help to mitigate the risks of Sybil attacks and DDoS attacks).</p>

			            <p>Streembit supports two types of network implementations:</p>
			            <ol type="a">
			                <li>Public network. Anyone can connect, there is no security gate enabled in the public network. The main Streembit network is public.</li>
			                <li>Private network, which implements a security gate to provide only a set of preconfigured contacts with access. A private Streembit network is isolated from the public Streembit network. Only certain peer nodes are allowed to connect to the network. The access control is governed by built in authentication functions. Typically, IoT devices within a building, teams, communities or businesses would run a private Streembit network to establish an even more secure communication mechanism than the public Streembit network. A private Streembit network is functioning as a firewall: only preconfigured contacts allowed to connect. The collection of the preconfigured contacts is maintained in a lookup list. The connection of devices and users which are not in the preconfigured list is refused by the private network.</li>

                      	<p>Streembit is a unified communication platform for both human users and Internet of Things devices.</p>

			            <p>Streembit manages device discovery as well as authentication, access control and provisioning of devices without using a centralized authority server. The system facilitates device discovery and device control in a peer to peer manner. For many IoT use cases a decentralized, P2P network topology is the most secure, robust, scalable and reliable method of operation. Instead of using expensive corporate owned third party cloud systems, Streembit manages Internet of Things devices without the need of proprietary centralized cloud platforms. Centralized, corporate owned cloud is certainly an easier way to build out IoT platforms. However, the owners and authorities in these topologies all have an influence upon the network and can be exploited. They can ban devices, spy on devices and compromise data integrity of devices. In fact, government can order them to do any or all of these. In the near future, the doors of your garage and home, air conditioning units and your home security system will be fully internet connected. You will be able to control your home automation system from your mobile phone. It is essential that only you can control your IoT devices. Streembit excludes third party service and cloud providers from the ecosystem to give full control to the end users over the devices.</p>

			            <p>The primary premise of this system is that all aspects of the IoT device operation must consist of decentralized P2P communication between the device and human user. For example, in the case of a building’s door device: a secure and decentralized P2P system can manage the door (including device configuration, upgrades and provisioning). There is no need to involve a centralized server nor a cloud based solution in order to implement a secure and fully operation Internet of Things system.</p>

			            <p>Streembit allows IoT application providers and context producers to register their IoT Objects on the decentralised Streembit network, and in turn allow context consumers to discover them in a secure and peer to peer manner. </p>

                      	<p>The seed nodes and client nodes of a private Streembit hub identify users by a) validating their PPK signature, b) looking up the account name from a configuration list. That means seeds and clients must know about the public keys and account names of the participants on the private Streembit hub. Therefore, prior to connecting a private Streembit hub you must share your account details with at least the seed node of private Streembit hub. Typically, you would do this by configuring the seed node configuration file with the list of contacts. (Please refer to the private network readme document at the Streembit Github repository how to create the configuration file for a private Streembit hub.)</p>
            			<p>To get your public key either create a new account or initialize an existing account. Click on the Streembit/New account menu item to create a new account or click on the Streembit/Initialize existing account to use an existing account. Once your account is initialized click on the Tools/Account security info menu item. Your account name and public key will be displayed on the screen. Add this  account name and public key data to the configuration file of private Streembit hub seed.</p>
