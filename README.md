## Streembit - decentralized, P2P communication system for humans and Internet of Things devices.

https://streembit.co/

What is Streembit?
-----------------

Streembit is an open source, peer-to-peer communication network for humans and machines. We aim to solve secure, decentralized network formation with Streembit. Streembit uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: discovering contacts, persisting the data and routing messages are carried out collectively by the network. It is primarily secured by elliptic curve public/private key cryptography infrastructure (PPKI). 

Streembit comes with video calls, audio calls, text chat, file transfer, screen sharing, and the ability to connect to your Internet-of-Things devices.

Streembit is optimized for the Internet-of-Things. Along with complying with open security and communication standards our developers take an active role in the W3C Web of Things Initiative (https://github.com/w3c/web-of-things-framework) and mirror all WoT standards in the Streembit codebase.

Building Streembit
-----------------

If you would like to build Streembit from the source instead of using the prebuilt binaries (found at http://streembit.github.io/download) follow the build workflow described in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/streembit/streembitui/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Streembit Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The developer [forum](https://gitter.im/streembit)
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.


Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`


### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
